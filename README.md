- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular, TypeScript, UI/UX, Robot Framework

- In my free time I like to work out with calisthenics rings! Trying to make personal progress in both physical and mental health. 
- Currently developing Solina, a web app to get more in tune with your emotions. In these times, alexithymia is way too common and I would like to make a difference.
